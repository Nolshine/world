light particles fall from the top, plants pick'em up
and beneath are bugs that eat small plants
maybe the bugs should be able to detract from the size of bigger
plants.

plants should be made from trunk and leaves, and if no leaves = trunk dead.

Maybe bigger bugs should eat smaller bugs.

What the light particles give is energy.
Energy is used to grow everything else.

When living things have enough energy they should breed.
All living things should have a short lifespan.





So, my brain tells me that the first life form I write should be grass.
i had a few ideas.


One of them is that grass is made from two types of components,
the base, and solar pods of some sort. Now, I gotta think ahead
because bugs are supposed to be able to munch on small plants like this
alien grass thing. Simplest way to do this is when a small bug approaches
the base, it eats 'til it's full, and detracts however much energy it eats
from the plants own stocks. But I could also do something like:
    bug finds plant, climbs up to a pod, and eats the pod.
I also think the pods should eventually drop and become seeds.
Perhaps they should do that when the plant dies, if the plant has enough energy.
